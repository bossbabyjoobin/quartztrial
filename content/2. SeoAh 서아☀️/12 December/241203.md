Hi WAV 
Here are my slightly late thoughts on (winning at) MMA ㅎㅎ
First of all, thank you so much. Honestly, I don’t say things like this often, so it feels a bit awkward but… thank you so so much. This wasn’t an experience you get to have every day which made the stage feel even more precious and nerve-wracking.

To be honest, there were a lot of things I wish I had done better and I made some mistakes too. But I believe these experiences will come together to help me grow. So even though it’s disappointing, I see it as a valuable stepping stone! Until last year, I’d only ever watched this stage on TV, so standing on it myself this time made me even more nervous and excited. Since we weren’t a full group this time, I really missed my unnies. Maybe next time, we’ll be able to come as a full group, right? ㅎㅎ Thank you for giving me such a valuable experience, even though I know I'm still lacking. And now that there's less than a month left in 2024, it really feels strange and kind of surreal ㅋㅋ

I still remember the day I first met the members, it was such a cold day. Time has passed and now cold winter has come. 
I vividly remember the day I was revealed.  So many people reached out to me that day and I still recall all the mix of reactions I received. Some people congratulated me while others doubted me. 

When I first heard _Girls Never Die_ and had to prepare for it in a rush, those days weren’t filled with joy and excitement. Instead, I think I often felt lonely, sad and worried. But as those days passed, May 8th finally arrived, and it's the day of our showcase. Honestly, I don’t think I had any thoughts running through my mind. I just told myself to perform the way I’d always practiced. I managed to finish without crying but what brought me to tears in the end was seeing my family ㅋㅋ The moment I saw them, I couldn’t help but cry. 

From my first music show to fan meetings, concerts and all the other activities, everything was so new and unfamiliar to me. Yet WAVs always told me I worked hard, thanked me and praised me for doing well, even when I was still inexperienced. Thank you so much (for that). 

We met in spring and now it’s already a snowy winter. The year 2024, which once felt so long, is now coming to an end. This time will never come back again, it was so precious and full of meaningful experiences. Although there were both regrets and good moments in 2024, I was truly happy because of WAVs. Thank you. 

Even though 2024 is ending, I’m so excited for all the time we’ll spend together in the future. And from March until now, I’m so grateful to the 23 unnies who have supported me. I know I’m still lacking in many ways but I’m always grateful, time and time again.

Lastly, since this is the last month of 2024, I hope you spend it without any regrets. Of course, it’s impossible to always be happy but since this precious time won't come back, I sincerely hope every single moment brings you happiness.
