Hiiii
It's 5 PM and it's already pitch dark outside
I haven't had dinner yet
I’m not hungry, so I’m still undecided about what to eat
I'm in the vocal room
크크
`[VM🎤: tripleS Aria - Door (All VM's are below)]` 
🚪🚪  
This is hard...  
크크
So, what should I do now?  
What song should I sing?...  
`[WM🎤: Jaurim - Twenty-Five, Twenty-One]`
Actually, this is one of my go-to songs ㅋㅋ
크크
Sudden Shower?  
It's been a while
It's been way too long since I sang *Sudden Shower*  
Ugh, this is hard  
`[VM🎤: ECLIPSE - Sudden Shower]`
I kept re-recording because I wasn't happy with some parts ㅋㅋ
`[VM🎤: tripleS Glow - Inner Dance]`
In between...  
it got kinda funny ㅋㅋㅋ
Sorry, I couldn't hold in my laugh ㅋㅋㅋ
🌊 Haerin-ah, would it be hard to take a selfie in the vocal room?

I didn’t put on makeup today
ㅋ커커
허허
It's a secret <sup>[t/n: her bare face]</sup>
I'll bring a different selfie next time  
Today, the photoism I took with Binnie unnie  
Unnie sent it, right?  
크크
I know everything
`[VM🎤: ROSÉ, Bruno Mars - APT]`
When I first heard about _APT_
I actually thought it was Yoon Soo-il sunbaenim's *Apartment*<sup>[released in 1982 ^~^]</sup>
크크
I love *APT.* so much
`[VM🎤: ROSÉ, Bruno Mars - APT. intro (S17, S18 & S23 ver.)]`
Guess who?
It's Binnie unnie and Lynn unnie 
크크크
I’ll try singing my favorite KIA Tigers cheer song
`[VM🎤: KIA Tigers Cheering Song]`
Gwangju's Battle Cry
It's the best (cheer song)...  
🌊 Thanks to Haerin, I got a baseball quiz question right at school

ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
That's a good thing, right...?  
Next year, I want to try throwing the first pitch  
If they call me, I'll run straight there 
🏃‍♀️  
🌊 First batter?

JooBin unnie...?  
I'm trying to convince her these days 
to watch baseball with me ㅋㅋ
크크
Next year, I want to try a Signal live at the game  
I’ll give it a go sometime later
I'm going now
크크
Cheer up today too  
and sleep well in advance  
Eat something delicious for dinner
