I sent my pictures to Oppa and asked "How do I look?" 
Oppa replied "It’s me"
`[VM: Oppa said it looks exactly like him]`
I’ll send a voice message…
`[VM: So, I sent a vomiting emoticon]`
`[VM: I was like "Where? Where exactly?" Oppa replied "Why are you upset? Our eyes, nose and lips all look the same"]`
`[VM: Honestly, I wanted to say something to disagree but I couldn't deny it. We really do look alike]`
ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
