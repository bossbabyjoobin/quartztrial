WAV!!  
Did you see our MMA stage??  
Hehe
It was actually my first time performing at an award ceremony, even though I’ve attended one with tripleS before <sup>[HMA 2023]</sup>
I was so nervous right up until the performance... and even while performing 
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Since it was my first awards ceremony performance and also a stage in front of such a big crowd, I really wanted to show a cooler side of myself, so I worked really hard
But honestly, I was so nervous that I can barely even remember how I did it
It felt like the performance ended in just three seconds ㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So, I kept rewatching the video and I really wanted to thank our WAVs for giving us such an amazing opportunity 🤍🤍
Thanks to WAVs, we were able to receive the Global Icon Award 
and I’m so so grateful 
🥹🤍
I really didn’t expect to receive an award at all
If you watch it again, you'll see me completely shocked with my eyes wide open<sup>[VID below]</sup>
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I’m also so thankful to our members who worked so hard ❤️
The fact that we can meet as a member of tripleS, I think I'm so lucky
From now on, I’ll continue to grow and show even more of our potential!!!!! 
Look forward to it
